This 29 year old DJ and producer was signed to EMI Music Australia, which is part of Universal Music Australia. She began her musical career as a career as a cellist in the Sydney Youth Opera and later the bassist in an indie band. In 2014 she embarked on a national tour playing in warehouses across Australia. Wonderland’s debut album, Run, was released on 20 March 2015. Her genre varies from trap, future garage, chill wave, alternative dance and EDM. She truly knows how to play with sound and is not afraid to deviate from the norm. She once said in an interview, when asked if she ever played classical music in her set: “actually, yes. I once opened a set with a Strauss track which features a cello. It was a proud moment, I actually got the crowd to waltz. `You can also hear the intense violin and cello sound in her music.Alison Wonderland gained popularity after her debut single “Get Ready” which features rapper Fishing was released on January 1, 2013. Soon after on June 27, 2014 her debut EP “Calm Down” was released and peaked at 38 on the ARIA chart, which preceded with singles “I Want U” and “Cold”. \r\n“On February 11, 2015 Wonderland released the lead single from her debut album titled “U Don’t Know” which featured Wayne Coyne from The Flaming Lips along with the music video which gained popularity because of Christopher Mintz-Plasse’s lead role in the video against Wonderland. It managed to peak at 63 on the ARIA charts. The single currently has over 3 Million streams on Spotify as of Janurary 20, 2016. Her debut album Run was then released on March 20, 2015 in Australia and April 7, 2015 in the United States. It featured many Australian artists including Slumberjack, and SAFIA as well as producers from around the world such as Djemba Djemba, Awe, and Lido. “ \r\nAlison Wonderland is an incredible artist due to her entire devotion throughout her album, not only is she a producer but also a vocalist, and her album is original and different. Alison Wonderland was nominated for two ARIA awards in 2015, Best Dance Release (for the single ‘Run’) and Best Video (for “U Don’t Know” featuring Wayne Coyne). The latter being a publicly voted category. She was one of eight nominees to gain exactly two nominations, other nominees included The Veronicas, 5 Seconds Of Summer, the Australian Brandenburg Orchestra, Meg Mac, Peking Duk and more. \r\nShe is a very interesting person. She wants to keep her personal life secretive. She doesn’t want people to know her age, nor even her real name. She also truly hates labels. She does not want to be regarded as a feminist. She wants people to judge her by the music she makes. Alison hates that she is constantly called and viewed as a female DJ. She is a DJ, and a good one at it, and would like to be compared to all DJs in the music industry, even if it is dominated by men. \r\n  \r\nShe recently stated in an interview: “I don’t want it to be about being a girl. I just want to be an artist,” she says. “The fact that in every interview I get asked about females in the music industry is a reflection on how females in the industry are perceived.” \r\n  \r\n“You see a little blonde girl up on stage, and what do you think?” she says. “People doubt if I’m actually mixing up on stage, and I think that if I was a guy they would never question that. That really pisses me off.” To debunk this perception, Wonderland uses a GoPro camera to film her hands, projecting the images to the crowd. Even so “people still doubt me,” she says, but adds that her sceptics are dwindling. \r\nI personally remember the first time I got to see Alison Wonderland live, it was at Electric Forest 2015, and I was amazed. Such a small girl but such incredible energy and a big personality. She immediately intrigued me. Such a cute voice yet such an immense personality. Her music contained so much bass, and I could not stop moving. \r\n  \r\n“On stage, splashes of strobe lights showcase an energy that belies the delicacy of her frame. Even Wonderland’s video clips are infused with an edgy rebellion. Her most out-there single, Get Ready, features young girls rapping the lyrics, their faces painted in Goth-inspired clown make-up, black tears running down their cheeks. \r\nWonderland does not shy away from this point: her artistic identity is constructed to deliberately downplay “the woman aspect”. For example, she says this is the reason she wears oversized T-shirts to her shows. And despite her disavowal of gender, Wonderland openly acknowledges that the path to the top is a fight, not a ride. For women, she says, the fight for respect is an additional hurdle. \r\n“I’m quite competitive with men, and I remember when I started, I would get judged. So I’d go home and I’d practise every week, and I’d come back with a new trick. And that’s how I got better. It just motivated me to keep going. “So what if, quite by accident, Alison Wonderland became an idol for young girls hoping to follow in her footsteps? \r\n“I hope so, I really do. If that’s what I became, I’d be happy. “ \r\nI’m very excited to get to see her tonight (10-02-2016) at Belmont in Montreal. I believe it’s going to be a fantastic show and that she will absolutely kill it. \r\nCitation: http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/alison-wonderland-warns-dont-label-me-a-female-dj-20140729-zsyw9.html#ixzz3znnkzQAA  \r\nSydney morning herald]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-11 00:24:19Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-11 00:24:41Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>https://blissfulconnection.wordpress.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Blissful Connection]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>0</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.clickshared.com/student-com-bags-60m-to-grow-the-reach-of-its-student-digs-marketplace</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Student.com Bags $60M To Grow The Reach Of Its Student Digs Marketplace]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Student.com, an accommodation marketplace founded back in 2011 (as ‘Overseas Student Living’ before rebranding last year) to focus specifically on the needs of international students, is announcing a $60 million combined Series B and C round today, led by global investment firm VY Capital.

As the winter progresses, my acoustic and indie folk inclinations rise. I am a devoted fan to singer-songwriters like Ben Howard, Ed Sheeran, Gabrielle Aplin, Lewis Watson, and many other talented artists from the UK. However, this winter, I’ve seen myself drift from such artists and genres. \r\nUnlike my typical winters, this one has completely thrown me off and I blame that on the unusual weather patterns.  My preferred genres this season seemed to have turned to “chill” and electronic. I’ve been really digging Snakehips, Disclosure, Kygo, Flume, Modi, and a plethora of others within this range. What made this unconscious mindset change so dramatically? Well, definitely the warm weather (though there have been a few frigid days thrown in the mix) and probably the use of the “Discover” tab on Spotify. I’ve never really opted for this tool until I came across some of my favorite “undiscovered” artists on there. I thought, “Hey, why not? I might as well give it a try!” so I pressed play, placed the songs on shuffle, and as the beats progressed, I noticed myself adding the suggestions to some of my ongoing playlists. I discovered so many new artists that were unknown to me prior and through clicking around their profiles, I continuously searched the related artists and discovered even more artists that weren’t and still aren’t mainstream. \r\nWhile listening to these songs, my goose bumps were “spooked” in such a positive way that I continuously kept creating “… & chill” playlists and compiling new, what I like to call “vibing”, songs into these curated mixes. Although I have felt some detachment to my beloved, heart-wrenching love ballads and soft acoustic guitar rhythms, I have been loving the songs that I can just sit, stare, and think about nothing as these beats crash amongst me.]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-11 00:09:08Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-11 00:19:46Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.lipsandlash.co/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[LIPS & LASHES]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>0</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Music]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[chill]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[disclosure]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[electronic]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[flume]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[kygo]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[modi]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[snakehips]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[vibes]]></tag>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[winter]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d68e637c-cfdb-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/companies_technology/feed//product</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Student.com gets $60m from Spotify backers]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Student accommodation marketplace saw $110m in bookings last year]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-11 00:05:57Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-11 00:25:22Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.ft.com/companies/technology</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Technology]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>200</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>5</blogRank>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d68e637c-cfdb-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377.html?ftcamp=published_links/rss/companies_us/feed//product</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Student.com gets $60m from Spotify backers]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Student accommodation marketplace saw $110m in bookings last year]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-11 00:05:57Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-11 00:27:09Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.ft.com/companies/us</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[US & Canadian companies]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>799</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>7</blogRank>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>https://bookkeepingadvice.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/tech-investors-from-spotify-xiaomi-vy</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Tech Investors from Spotify, Xiaomi, VY]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Tech Investors from Spotify, Xiaomi, VY Capital and Horizon Bet On Study Abroad Site Student.com http://ow.ly/3bb3Kg]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-11 00:05:43Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-11 00:28:46Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>https://bookkeepingadvice.wordpress.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Book Keeping Advice]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>0</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post></twinglydata>", { server: 'nginx',
